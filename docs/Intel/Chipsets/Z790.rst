Introduction
================

Z790 is a high-end chipset for the :doc:`/Intel/LGA1700` socket.
Both motherboards using :doc:`/Memory/DDR4` and :doc:`/Memory/DDR5` exist on this socket (but never both simultaneously!).
While some motherboard vendors (Gigabyte) denoted the Z790 refresh as "Z790 X", the chipsets are actually identical.
